# NYC-Cars-Crash
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive database to analyze passenger car collisions in New York City. The primary goal is to provide reliable and detailed data that helps identify trends, contributing factors, and risk elements associated with vehicle accidents. 
This database serves as a tool for understanding accident patterns, improving traffic regulations, and implementing safety measures. By leveraging structured query language (SQL) and relational database management principles, we developed a comprehensive and efficient system for storing and analyzing collision data.
